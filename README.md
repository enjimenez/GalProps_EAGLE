Python script that computes 2D smoothed maps of the Toomre-Q parameter for the stellar and gaseous components of EAGLE-like galaxies. 
Calculations of local velocity dispersion and surface density are based on the positions, velocities and masses of SPH particles where the smooothing is performed by the Py-SPHViewer code (Benitez-Llambay, 2015). 
See Apendix B1 in Jimenez et al. (2023) for a detailed description of the algorithm.
